# MS_project_01
This is a test repository in which I will try learning the functionalities of Git and Git hub.
git is a version control system (devops tool used for sourse code management). This basically tracks history of sourse code and lets us collabarate efficiently.
Readme.md is a file where the information about the project is usually stored. Here we can describe the project.
md = mark down.
1st add change then commit or rollback.
commit = finalised change.
installed git bash and set it up.
~ (tilled) symbol shows that we are in our root direectory.
